# Introduction

`agent-device` is a CLI for automating iOS simulators and Android emulators (and devices) from agents. It provides:

- Accessibility snapshots for UI understanding
- Deterministic interactions (tap, type, scroll)
- Session-aware workflows and replay

If you know `agent-browser`, this is the mobile-native counterpart focused on simulators and emulators.

## What it’s good at

- Capturing structured UI state for LLMs
- Driving common UI actions with refs or semantic selectors
- Replaying flows for regression checks

## Architecture (high level)

1. CLI sends requests to the daemon.
2. The daemon manages sessions and dispatches to platform drivers.
3. iOS uses XCTest runner for snapshots and input; AX is optional fallback.
4. Android uses ADB-based tooling.

## Example

```bash
# Navigate and get snapshot
agent-device open Settings --platform ios
agent-device snapshot -i
# Output
# Page: Contacts
# App: com.apple.MobileAddressBook
# Snapshot: 44 nodes
# @e1 [application] "Contacts"
#  @e2 [window]
#    @e3 [other]
#  @e4 [other] "Lists"
#    @e5 [navigation-bar] "Lists"
#      @e6 [button] "Lists"
#      @e7 [text] "Contacts"
#    @e8 [other] "John Doe"

# Click and fill
agent-device click @e8
agent-device snapshot -i
agent-device fill @e5 "Doe 2"
agent-device close
```

# Commands

This page summarizes the primary command groups.

## Navigation

```bash
agent-device boot
agent-device boot --platform ios
agent-device boot --platform android
agent-device open [app]
agent-device close [app]
agent-device back
agent-device home
agent-device app-switcher
```

- `boot` ensures the selected target is ready without launching an app.
- `boot` requires either an active session or an explicit device selector.
- `boot` is mainly needed when starting a new session and `open` fails because no booted simulator/emulator is available.
- `open [app]` already boots/activates the selected target when needed.

## Snapshot and inspect

```bash
agent-device snapshot [-i] [-c] [-d <depth>] [-s <scope>] [--raw] [--backend ax|xctest]
agent-device get text @e1
agent-device get attrs @e1
```

## Interactions

```bash
agent-device click @e1
agent-device focus @e2
agent-device fill @e2 "text"          # Clear then type
agent-device type "text"              # Type into focused field without clearing
agent-device press 300 500
agent-device press 300 500 --count 12 --interval-ms 45
agent-device press 300 500 --count 6 --hold-ms 120 --interval-ms 30 --jitter-px 2
agent-device swipe 540 1500 540 500 120
agent-device swipe 540 1500 540 500 120 --count 8 --pause-ms 30 --pattern ping-pong
agent-device long-press 300 500 800
agent-device scroll down 0.5
agent-device pinch 2.0          # zoom in 2x (iOS simulator)
agent-device pinch 0.5 200 400 # zoom out at coordinates (iOS simulator)
```

`fill` clears then types. `type` does not clear.
On Android, `fill` also verifies text and performs one clear-and-retry pass on mismatch.
`swipe` accepts an optional `durationMs` argument (default `250ms`, range `16..10000`).
On iOS, swipe timing uses a safe normalized duration to avoid long-press side effects.
`pinch` is iOS-simulator-only in the current adb-backed Android implementation.

## Find (semantic)

```bash
agent-device find "Sign In" click
agent-device find label "Email" fill "user@example.com"
agent-device find role button click
```

## Replay

```bash
agent-device replay ./session.ad      # Run deterministic replay from .ad script
agent-device replay -u ./session.ad   # Update selector drift and rewrite .ad script in place
```

- `replay` runs deterministic `.ad` scripts.
- `replay -u` updates stale recorded actions and rewrites the same script.

See [Replay & E2E (Experimental)](/agent-device/pr-preview/pr-57/docs/replay-e2e.md) for recording and CI workflow details.

## App reinstall (fresh state)

```bash
agent-device reinstall com.example.app ./build/app.apk --platform android
agent-device reinstall com.example.app ./build/MyApp.app --platform ios
```

- `reinstall <app> <path>` uninstalls and installs in one command.
- Supports Android devices/emulators and iOS simulators in v1.
- Useful for login/logout reset flows and deterministic test setup.

## Settings helpers

```bash
agent-device settings wifi on
agent-device settings wifi off
agent-device settings airplane on
agent-device settings airplane off
agent-device settings location on
agent-device settings location off
```

## Media and logs

```bash
agent-device screenshot                 # Auto filename
agent-device screenshot page.png        # Explicit screenshot path
agent-device record start               # Start screen recording to auto filename
agent-device record start session.mp4   # Start recording to explicit path
agent-device record stop                # Stop active recording
```

# Quick Start

Every device automation follows this pattern:

```bash
# 1. Navigate
agent-device open SampleApp --platform ios # or android

# 2. Snapshot to get element refs
agent-device snapshot -i
# Output:
# @e1 [heading] "Sample App"
# @e2 [button] "Settings"

# 3. Interact using refs
agent-device click @e2

# 4. Re-snapshot before next interactions
agent-device snapshot -i
```

boot simulator if there's none available:

```bash
agent-device boot --platform ios # or android
```

## Common commands

```bash
agent-device open SampleApp
agent-device snapshot -i                 # Get interactive elements with refs
agent-device click @e2                   # Click by ref
agent-device fill @e3 "test@example.com" # Clear then type (Android verifies and retries once if needed)
agent-device get text @e1                # Get text content
agent-device screenshot page.png         # Save to specific path
agent-device close
```

If `open` fails because no booted simulator/emulator is available, run `boot --platform ios|android` and retry.

## Semantic discovery

Use `find` for human-readable targeting without refs:

```bash
agent-device find "Sign In" click
agent-device find label "Email" fill "user@example.com"
agent-device find role button click
```

## Replay (experimental)

For deterministic replay scripts and E2E guidance, see [Replay & E2E (Experimental)](/agent-device/pr-preview/pr-57/docs/replay-e2e.md).

## Scrolling

Navigate content that extends beyond the viewport:

```bash
agent-device scroll down 0.5            # Scroll down half screen
agent-device scroll up 0.3              # Scroll up 30%
```

## Settings helpers

Toggle device settings directly:

```bash
agent-device settings wifi on
agent-device settings airplane on
agent-device settings location off
```

## JSON output

For programmatic parsing in scripts:

```bash
agent-device snapshot --json
agent-device get text @e1 --json
```

Note: The default text output is more compact and preferred for AI agents.

# Replay & E2E Testing (Experimental)

Agents use refs for exploration and authoring. Replay scripts are deterministic runs that can be used for E2E testing.

## Core model

Two-pass workflow:

1. Agent pass: discover and interact with refs (`snapshot` -> `click @e..` / `fill @e..`).
2. Deterministic pass: run recorded `.ad` script with `replay`.

## Record a replay script

Enable recording during a session:

```bash
agent-device open Settings --platform ios --session e2e --save-script
agent-device snapshot -i --session e2e
agent-device click @e13 --session e2e
agent-device close --session e2e
```

On `close`, a replay script is written to:

```text
~/.agent-device/sessions/<session>-<timestamp>.ad
```

## Run replay

```bash
agent-device replay ~/.agent-device/sessions/e2e-2026-02-09T12-00-00-000Z.ad --session e2e-run
```

- Replay reads `.ad` scripts.

## Update stale selectors in replay scripts

```bash
agent-device replay -u ~/.agent-device/sessions/e2e-2026-02-09T12-00-00-000Z.ad --session e2e-run
```

When a replay step fails, update can:

- Take a fresh snapshot.
- Resolve a stable replacement target.
- Retry the step.
- Rewrite the failing line in the same `.ad` file.

Current update targets:

- `click`
- `fill`
- `get`
- `is`
- `wait`

## `replay -u` before/after examples

Example 1: stale selector rewritten in place

```sh
# Before
click "id=\"old_continue\" || label=\"Continue\""

# After `replay -u`
click "id=\"auth_continue\" || label=\"Continue\""
```

Example 2: stale ref-based action upgraded to selector form

```sh
# Before
snapshot -i -c -s "Continue"
click @e13 "Continue"

# After `replay -u`
snapshot -i -c -s "Continue"
click "id=\"auth_continue\" || label=\"Continue\""
```

Use `replay -u` locally during maintenance, review the rewritten `.ad` lines, then commit the updated script.

## Troubleshooting

- Replay fails after UI/layout changes:
  - Run `replay -u` locally and review the rewritten lines.
- Updating cannot resolve a unique target:
  - Re-record that flow (`--save-script`) from a fresh exploratory pass.
- Replay file parse error:
  - Validate quoting in `.ad` lines (unclosed quotes are rejected).

# Selectors

Use `find` to locate elements by semantic attributes instead of raw refs.

```bash
agent-device find "Settings" click
agent-device find text "Sign In" click
agent-device find label "Email" fill "user@example.com"
agent-device find value "Search" type "query"
agent-device find role button click
agent-device find id "com.example:id/login" click
```

Tips:

- Use `find ... wait <timeoutMs>` to wait for UI to appear.
- Combine with scoped snapshots using `snapshot -s "<label>"` for speed.
- \[Android] If a matched node is not hittable, agent-device will click/focus the nearest hittable ancestor.

# Sessions

Sessions keep device state and snapshots consistent across commands.

```bash
agent-device open Settings --platform ios
agent-device session list
agent-device open Contacts          # change app while reusing the default session
agent-device close
```

Open another session independently (for parallel work):

```bash
agent-device open Contacts --platform ios --session my-session
agent-device snapshot -i
agent-device close --session my-session
```

Notes:

- `open <app>` within an existing session switches the active app and updates the session bundle id.
- Use `--session <name>` to run multiple sessions in parallel.

For replay scripts and deterministic E2E guidance, see [Replay & E2E (Experimental)](/agent-device/pr-preview/pr-57/docs/replay-e2e.md).

# Snapshots

Snapshots provide a structured view of the UI and generate stable refs.

```bash
agent-device snapshot                    # Full accessibility tree
agent-device snapshot -i                 # Interactive elements only (recommended)
agent-device snapshot -c                 # Compact (remove empty elements)
agent-device snapshot -d 3               # Limit depth to 3 levels
agent-device snapshot -s "Contacts"      # Scope to label/identifier
agent-device snapshot -i -c -d 5         # Combine options
```

| Option       | Description               |
| ------------ | ------------------------- |
| `-i`         | Interactive-only output   |
| `-c`         | Compact structural noise  |
| `-d <depth>` | Limit tree depth          |
| `-s <scope>` | Scope to label/identifier |

Note: If XCTest returns 0 nodes (foreground app changed), agent-device falls back to AX when available.

## Example output:

```bash
agent-device snapshot -i
# Output:
# Snapshot: 44 nodes
# @e1 [application] "Contacts"
#   @e2 [window]
#     @e3 [other]
#   @e4 [other] "Lists"
#     @e5 [navigation-bar] "Lists"
#       @e6 [button] "Lists"
#       @e7 [text] "Contacts"
#     @e8 [other] "John Doe"
#       @e9 [other] "John Doe"
```

## Backends (iOS):

- `xctest` (default): full fidelity, fast, no Accessibility permission required.
- `ax`: fast accessibility tree, may miss details, requires Accessibility permission.

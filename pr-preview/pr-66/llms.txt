> CLI to control iOS and Android devices for AI agents

## Docs

- [Introduction](/agent-device/pr-preview/pr-66/docs/introduction.md): agent-device is a CLI for automating iOS simulators + physical devices and Android emulators + devices from agents. It provides: Accessibility snapshots for UI understandingDeterministic interactions (tap, type, scroll)Session-aware workflows and replay If you know agent-browser, this is the mobile-native counterpart for iOS/Android UI automation.

- [Quick Start](/agent-device/pr-preview/pr-66/docs/quick-start.md): Every device automation follows this pattern: Boot target if there is no ready device/simulator:
- [Replay & E2E Testing (Experimental)](/agent-device/pr-preview/pr-66/docs/replay-e2e.md): Agents use refs for exploration and authoring. Replay scripts are deterministic runs that can be used for E2E testing.
- [Selectors](/agent-device/pr-preview/pr-66/docs/selectors.md): Use find to locate elements by semantic attributes instead of raw refs. Tips: Use find ... wait <timeoutMs> to wait for UI to appear.Combine with scoped snapshots using snapshot -s "<label>" for speed.[Android] If a matched node is not hittable, agent-device will click/focus the nearest hittable ancestor.
- [Sessions](/agent-device/pr-preview/pr-66/docs/sessions.md): Sessions keep device state and snapshots consistent across commands. Open another session independently (for parallel work): Notes: open <app> within an existing session switches the active app and updates the session bundle id.open <url> in iOS sessions is simulator-only.On iOS, appstate is session-scoped and requires a matching active session on the target device.Use --session <name> to run multiple sessions in parallel. For replay scripts and deterministic E2E guidance, see Replay & E2E (Experimental).
- [Snapshots](/agent-device/pr-preview/pr-66/docs/snapshots.md): Snapshots provide a structured view of the UI and generate stable refs. Note: If XCTest returns 0 nodes (foreground app changed), agent-device fails explicitly.
It does not automatically switch to AX.

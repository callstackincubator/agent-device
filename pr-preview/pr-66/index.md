# Control iOS and Android devices with AI agents.

> agent-device is a token-efficient, lightweight CLI for iOS and Android device automation. Gives your agents "eyes" to see and "hands" to interact with the UI.

[Get Started](/docs/introduction) | [Commands](/docs/commands)

## Features

- **One CLI, many devices**: Control iOS simulators + physical devices and Android emulators + devices with consistent snapshot and interaction commands.
- **Token-efficient UI snapshots**: XCTest accessibility trees give agents a complete view of the UI while keeping output compact.
- **Interactions that just work**: Tap, swipe, scroll, focus, and type with precise coordinates or semantic finders.
- **Session and replay**: Open apps, switch apps in-session, and replay recorded actions to reproduce flows across platforms.
- **Visual verification**: Capture full-resolution screenshots for reporting and visual checks.
- **Traceable automation**: Collect trace logs for XCTest and AX to debug flaky interactions.

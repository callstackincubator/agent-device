- [Commands](/agent-device/docs/commands.md): This page summarizes the primary command groups.
- [Installation](/agent-device/docs/installation.md)
- [Quick Start](/agent-device/docs/quick-start.md): Every device automation follows this pattern:
- [Selectors](/agent-device/docs/selectors.md): Use find to locate elements by semantic attributes instead of raw refs. Tips: Use find ... wait <timeoutMs> to wait for UI to appear.Combine with scoped snapshots using snapshot -s "<label>" for speed.[Android] If a matched node is not hittable, agent-device will click/focus the nearest hittable ancestor.
- [Sessions](/agent-device/docs/sessions.md): Sessions keep device state and snapshots consistent across commands. Open another session independently (for parallel work): Notes: open <app> within an existing session switches the active app and updates the session bundle id.Use --session <name> to run multiple sessions in parallel.
- [Snapshots](/agent-device/docs/snapshots.md): Snapshots provide a structured view of the UI and generate stable refs. Note: If XCTest returns 0 nodes (foreground app changed), agent-device falls back to AX when available.
